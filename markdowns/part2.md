# High Order Funcion


In functionnal programming a function is defined has "first order citizen". 
It means that it has exactly the same properties than other element : it can be affect to a name or not, return as a result or passed in parameter.

It's what we will try now.
Just implement the greeting function to return "Hello, [name]" if the name is defined, "who are you?" else.
