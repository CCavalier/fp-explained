# High Order Function


In functionnal programming a function is defined as a "first order citizen". 
This means it includes all the properties generally available to any other element, such as the possibility of being affected to a name, returned as a result or passed as a parameter.

This is what we will try now.
Just implement the greeting function to return "Hello, [name]" if the name is defined, "who are you?" otherwise.
