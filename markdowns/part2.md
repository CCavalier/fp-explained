# High Order Funcion



Let's have a look to this function:

@[Check the ingredients list]({"stubs":["/src/main/scala/example/PureBoughtIngredients.scala"], "command":"example.TestBought"})


I changed the account of the user by removing the sum of the ingredients of the recipe.
But if if have more thing to buy, or discount, or if I already got some of the ingredients, this is unapropriated.

So we will separate the account operation from the recipe cost.
