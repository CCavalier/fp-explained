# That's all folks

We saw Functional Programming allows us to design program with a mathematical approach.
Immutability and function composition are two pillar of this approach, and are really adapted to scalabilty
We went throught the main functional aspects of Scala, but there still is so much to discover.

## To Go Further
If you are interested by javascript, you can have a look to Eric Eliott's blog and his series [Composing software](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-functional-programming-composable-software-c2d91b424c8c)

If you want to go deeper into scala, you should know that there real strenght are frameworks: have a look to Akka, Play or Spark, they could surprise you.
