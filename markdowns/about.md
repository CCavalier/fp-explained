##What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigmthat treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

 In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time : it's the notion of Pure function.

 These functions are easily composable (associated). It's an elegant way to design software.

 As functional programming has no side effect it's an excellent way to design program who need multithreading and scalability.
